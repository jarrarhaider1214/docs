# Serverless

Serverless framework helps developers build serverless applications with less cost and overheads. It provides a powerful and unified experience to develop, deploy and test serverless applications. It basically takes care of the end to end process of application development. 

Serverless applications can be developed and tested on different cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP. These applications can then also be secured and monitored. 

CloudPlex has made it easy to deploy serverless applications.. Not only deployment, CloudPlex also takes care of the creation process of serverless applications. These serverless applications can also be a part of CloudPlex that can contain services of different types like containers, managed services etc. By making all these different service types a part of single project in CloudPlex, we are making it easier for the user to develop and deploy complex applications using easy to use drag-n-drop interface of platform.

Details of the configurations that can be done for Serverless at application level are explained below and also highlighted in the image.

1. Specify **Image Url**.

2. Specify **Registry Tag**.

3. **Environment Variables**: To add static/dynamic environment variables or Load Balancer.

4. **Minimum Scale:** Minimum scale limit.

5. **Maximum Scale:** Maximum scale limit.

6. **Add Ports**: To add host and ports.

7. To enable **Enforce Internal Communication**.

   > By default services deployed through Knative are published to an external IP address, making them public services on a public IP address and with a public URL. In order to build a service that should not be available off-cluster user can enable enforce internal communication.

8. (If **Enforce Internal Communication** is not **Enabled**) **Add Domains** and **Labels**.

   > **Labels:** To configure a service to only be available on the cluster-local network (and not on the public Internet), a user can apply labels. To know more about labels, click [here](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/cluster-local-route/).
